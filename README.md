Overview
Story Frame is a unique website designed to turn audiobooks into a visually immersive experience. It is especially useful for:

- People who struggle to focus solely on audio.
- Individuals with aphantasia who have difficulty visualizing scenes.
- Young children who are learning to enjoy audiobooks and need a visual aid to stay engaged.
- Anyone who prefers additional visuals to enhance their audiobook experience.

Story frame makes it so as the audiobook plays, AI-generated dynamic pictures (which have slight movement in them) are displayed, matching the narrative in real-time.

How It Works
- Upload your audiobook: Simply upload your audiobook file into the platform.
- Speech-to-Text: Whisper automatically transcribes the audio into text.
- Descriptive Prompt Creation: The text is passed to ChatGPT, which generates a descriptive prompt of the current scene or setting.
- Image Generation: Stable Diffusion generates an AI-generated image based on the prompt.
- Dynamic Image Animation: The static image is then passed to Stable Diffusion's Automatic 1111 tool, which adds subtle movement to create a dynamic, animated visual
- Seamless Visual Updates: The dynamic moving image is updated every few seconds, offering a continuous flow of visuals that align with the audiobookâ€™s content.

Technologies Used
